Variety of Python scripts to work with PowerSchool

TeacherSchedule.py - 
This converts the Power School master list to a two semester Excel workbook. Teachers are listed alphabetically on left, with room then course in a 5 block layout. In PowerScheduler, you need to copy the report data, and save it in a simple text file. Then run the script choosing that file in the dialog box. An Excel spread sheet will be created with the same name as the text file.
